## 1. included materials
>In those code files, those may include some useless materials for other people who want to read.Here,i just show the important materials if you want to use my code.These have three folders which may include a lots of .py files

if you are intersted in this project, first folder which is **kickstarterforcollectingdata** should be focus on.

### **kickstarterforcollectingdata**
- this folder include main spiderbot program
- in the **kickstarterforcollectingdata** folder, you can find a folder named **reconstruction** . 
	- any things you want are all saved in this folder
- there is only one file you may be interested in: plan.py
	

## 2.files
- you may find a lot of txt files and csv or xlsx files, that are some data what i have collected until 4 July 2016. 
-PS: i will fully clean up those useless files when i finish my dissertation finally

## 3. codes
- I use python 2.7 to code  
- and when you run the code, you may find some number or path be required to type in, you should type full path into two parts.
	- one is public path for what dir/folder you want save the data. the dir/folder must include 4 csv files and one txt file.
	- another is the full name of target file(csv format) 
	- (those must be named as follow)
```
targetfile.csv
collected.txt
project_data.csv
rewards_backers_distribution.csv
rewards_pledge_limit.csv
rewards_pledged_amount.csv 				
```
	
-**the target file**  must include the target urls
